Assuming that the basic packages needed for compilation are already set up, let's proceed.

### Installing PostgreSQL Files

```bash
wget http://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/source/v12.1/postgresql-12.1.tar.gz
tar zxvf postgresql-12.1.tar.gz
cd postgresql-12.1
mkdir -p /APP/postgresql/data
```

### Source Compilation and Installation

```bash
./configure --prefix=/APP/postgresql --with-python --without-python --without-readline
make && make install
```

### Creating a Database Cluster

```bash
cd /APP/postgresql/bin
./initdb -E utf-8 /APP/postgresql/data/
--> Do not run as root

sudo chown -R estar /APP/postgresql/data
$ ./initdb -E utf-8 /APP/postgresql/data/
```

### Creating a Log File

```bash
$ sudo mkdir /APP/postgresql/logs
$ sudo chown estar /APP/postgresql/logs
$ ./pg_ctl -D /APP/postgresql/data_new/ -l /APP/postgresql/logs/logfile start
```

### Verification

```bash
$ netstat -tupln | grep 5432
(Not all processes could be identified, non-owned process info
 will not be shown, you would have to be root to see it all.)
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:5432          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      274993/postgres
tcp6       0      0 ::1:5432                :::*                    LISTEN      274993/postgres
```

The above steps guide you through manually installing PostgreSQL on an Ubuntu system. It's important to ensure that you have the necessary permissions and the correct setup environment before starting the installation process. This includes having appropriate access permissions for directory creation and file operations, which is vital for a successful setup.

This post assumes basic familiarity with command-line operations and managing permissions in a Linux environment. With these steps, PostgreSQL is manually set up and should be running, ready to handle database requests on the specified port.
